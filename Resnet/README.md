# How to Quantize a ResNet from Scratch

This is the final code associated with the Youtube tutorial at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dLSVrnuBXM

To run, merely `cd` into this folder, make sure you have PyTprch installed, and run `python quant_resnet.py`. 

Let me know if there are any issues!

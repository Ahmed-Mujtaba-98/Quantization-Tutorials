### Prerequisities:
To run this code, yopu need to have PyTorch installed in your environment. If you do not have PyTorch installed, please follow this [official guide](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).

I created this code with PyTorch Version: 2.1.1. In case you have any versioning issues, you can revert to that version.

### Running this code:
Once you have PyTprch isntalled,  merely `cd` into this folder, and run `python quant_resnet.py` from your command line! 

Let me know if there are any issues!

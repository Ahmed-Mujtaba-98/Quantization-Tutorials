# Quantization-Tutorials
A bunch of coding tutorials for my [Youtube videos on Neural Network Quantization](https://www.youtube.com/@NeuralNetworkQuantization)https://www.youtube.com/@NeuralNetworkQuantization.

This is the first coding tutorial. We take the `torchvision` `ResNet` model and quantize it entirely from scratch with the PyTorch quantization library.

We discuss common issues one can run into, as well as some interesting but tricky bugs.
